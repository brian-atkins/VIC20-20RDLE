VIC-20 version of the Wordle game.

Adapted from the original version https://github.com/Chysn/VIC20-20RDLE.

To use the game in an emulator such as VICE, download the 20rdle.prg file, set drive emulation to the host file system, set the host directory to where you have downloaded the file, and set the machine to have 24K memory expansion.

Refer to the images of VICE settings and load/run screen.

In the emulator, enter LOAD"20rdle.prg",8 and RUN.

To develop further using a Windows platform, clone or fork the repository, and use a development tool like VS Code with XA Assembler.

A build.bat file and a prependaddress.ps1 file are provided to help build a new 20rdle.prg file.
